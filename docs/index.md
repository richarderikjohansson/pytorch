# Documentation for PyTorch course

Here will all documentation be stored for the YouTube course 
relating to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). The course is 
hosted for free on YouTube and can be found [here](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=YHbNDR-orgsaQglD). 

The course have 10 chapters in total, with exercises tied to each 
chapter. GitHub repository, with the exercises can be found [here](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/main)
and documentation for the course can be found [here](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) 

## Data
One of the most fundamental things in Machine Learning is to split the data into:

1. Training data
2. Validation data
3. Test data

Where the training data is used to train the model to find the patterns you want. You then
validate your model with the validation data to see how well it performs, and adjust it 
if needed. Finally you use the test data to verify that the model is behaving as expected.
