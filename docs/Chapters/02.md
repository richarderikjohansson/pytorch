# PyTorch Neural Network Classification
In this chapter will how classifications models are developed 
in PyTorch. Classification is a very powerful tool and can 
be used for more or less any type of data. 

The core of a classification model is to figure out if 
some type of data is something, or not. For example, if a image is 
of a dog. The model will then be trained to correctly 
interpret whether a image dog and when properly
trained will the model be able to figure out if an inputted image 
is a dog or not. This is just a very simple example. For this chapters resources visit:
