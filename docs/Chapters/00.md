# PyTorch Fundamentals

This chapter was entirely about working with tensors in 
pytorch, as well working with random numbers. See 
documentation on `torch.Tensor()` [here](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html),
for creating `torch.rand()` [here](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.rand.html)
and seeding with `torch.random` [here](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/random.html) 

It is mostly about learning to navigate the documentation, and to get the habit of 
turning to this when needed.
