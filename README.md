# Learning PyTorch
In this repository we learn the Python Machine Learning library [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
I follow the tutorial seen in [PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=KD5LZkFavS6Us-S_).
Documentation for the various chapters and exercises can be seen in [Documentation](https://richarderikjohansson.github.io/pytorch/) 

## Running the code yourself
Install dependencies with uv and activate environment:

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Navigate navigate to `src/pytorch` and run, for example all training exercises for Chapter 1 with:

```bash
uv run ex01.py
```
